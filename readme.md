# RUVirtualFlyers

Rutgers Virtual Flyer. There's a lot to do / eat / see / play at Rutgers. We need an effective way to categorize it all! Your app should have a user creation / login system. It should have a way to add places for everyone to see. Only authenticated users can leave reviews and ratings. There should be a basic filter that lets users narrow down what they want to search for (only 5 star places, restaurants, etc).
